// FILTERING GREETING MESSAGES ACTIVITY

// In the first exercise, we'll start you off simple â€” we have an 
// array of greeting card messages, but we want to sort them to 
// list just the Christmas messages. We want you to fill in a 
// conditional test inside the if () structure to test each string
// and only print it in the list if it is a Christmas message.
//
// Think about how you could test whether the message in each case 
// is a Christmas message. What string is present in all of those 
// messages, and what method could you use to test whether it is present?

const greetings = ['Happy Birthday!',
                 'Merry Christmas my love',
                 'A happy Christmas to all the family',
                 'You\'re all I want for Christmas',
                 'Get well soon'];

for (const greeting of greetings) {
  // Your conditional test needs to go inside the parentheses
  // in the line below, replacing what's currently there
  // if (greeting) {
    if (greeting.includes('Christmas')) {
    console.log(greeting);
  }
}
