  Tower of Hanoi

  Tower of Hanoi is an old puzzle. You have three pegs with disks of different sizes
  on one of them; the objective is to move all disks to another peg, obeying simple
  rules:

  1. You can move only one disk at a time.
  2. You canâ€™t put a larger disk on a smaller one.

  ** create an algorithm **
  # play ends when all disks are stacked on the right-most tower
  # start with the smallest disk
  # if it can be moved to the right, do it
  # otherwise, if it can be moved to the left, do it
  # repeat for disk 2
  # repeat for disk 3
  # repeat all of the above until the game has ended

  ** create psuedocode**
