  Tower of Hanoi

  Tower of Hanoi is an old puzzle. You have three pegs with disks of different sizes
  on one of them; the objective is to move all disks to another peg, obeying simple
  rules:

  1. You can move only one disk at a time.
  2. You canâ€™t put a larger disk on a smaller one.

  ** create an algorithm **
  # play ends when all disks are stacked on the right-most tower
  # start with the smallest disk
  # if it can be moved to an empty tower two places to the right, move it there
  # if it can be moved to an empty tower one place to the right, move it there
  # if it can be moved to an empty tower two places on the left, move it there
  # if it can be moved to an empty tower one place to the left, move it there
  # otherwise, if it can be moved to an existing stack on the right, do it 
  # otherwise, if it can be moved to an existing stack on the left, do it
  # repeat for disk 2
  # repeat for disk 3
  # repeat all of the above until the game has ended

  ** diagram the algorithm **
  Towers: T1, T2, T3.
  Disks:  D1, D2, D3.
  # T1:D3/D2/D1   T2:         T3:
  # T1:D3/D2      T2:         T3:D1
  # T1:D3         T2:D2       T3:D1
  # T1:D3         T2:D2/D1    T3:
  # T1:           T2:D2/D1    T3:D3
  # T1:D1         T2:D2       T3:D3
  # T1:D1         T2:         T3:D3/D2
  # T1:           T2:         T3:D3/D2/D1

  # Game End
