/*
* THIRD HIGHEST NUMBER
*
* Directive:
* Ask the user to enter 10 numbers, and display the third highest.
*
* Outline:
* 01. We need a way for the user to input ten numbers.
* 02. We need a way for the program to read the user's numbers into memory.
* 03. We need a way to find the third highest number.
*
* Algorithm:
* 01. We need a way for the user to input ten numbers.
*    a. Add ten number input fields in HTML
*
* 02. We need a way for the program to read the user's numbers into memory.
*    a. Parse the input values into an array
*
* 03. We need a way to find the third highest number.
*    a. Use array.sort to sort the numbers in the array.
     b. Correct serialization.
       i. Write a function isGreaterThan(number, input) that returns true if input > number.
       ii. Iterate through the array and pass the numbers into the function, two-at-a-time.
       iii. If result is truthy, use array.splice to remove and move item to end of array.
       iv. repeat until the isGreaterThan is no longer truthy.
*    c. Return the third from last array item (3rd highest number)
