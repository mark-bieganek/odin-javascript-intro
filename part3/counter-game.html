  /*
  10 friends are sitting in a circle around a table and decide to play a 
  new game. In it, they count up through the numbers from 1 to 100. The 
  first person says "1", the second says "2" and so on... but with a few 
  catches:

  Whenever the number is divisible by 7, they switch directions. So 
  person 6 will say "6", person 7 will say "7", then person 6 again will 
  say "8".

  Whenever the number is divisible by 11, they skip the next person.
  Your job is to pseudocode a program which will determine which player 
  says the number 100. For this one, be as specific as possible to 
  actually write out the logic of the procedure.

  Once you've finished your procedure, be sure to walk through the logic 
  and make sure it is actually doing what it's supposed to.

  The key here isn't to actually come up with the answer to the problem 
  posed -- you should see how trivial that would be if you actually wrote 
  this using code. The real difficulty is making sure that you've set up 
  the problem properly in the first place.

  ** algorithm **
  PROGRAM CounterGame
      # Write down the player names, in the order they're seated around
      the table from seat 1 to seat 10.
      # Go around the table in ascending order, starting at player 1, 
      and have the players take turns saying the next number in a 
      numeric sequence from 1-100.
      # If a player says a number that can be divided by 7 with no 
      remainder, then reverse direction of play.
      # If a player says a number that can be divided by 11 with no
      remainder, then skip the next player.
      # Repeat until a player says "100".
      # Announce the player name that said "100".
  END
